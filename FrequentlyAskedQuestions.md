# Why do I get the message "License not present. With the trial verison only limited records are allowed."? #

If you build FlexMonkey from source, you will need a license for the Flex Automation API.

Flex Builder Standard edition provides a trial license of the [Flex Automation API](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/), which is the underlying mechanism used by FlexMonkey. The trial version limits you to 30 actions (record/playback).

# Does FlexMonkey work with custom components? #

FlexMonkey works with most custom components that extend concrete Flex
Components. Custom components that descend directly from UIComponent
require special handling as explained in InstrumentingForFlexMonkey.

AutoQuick is a sample application from Adobe demonstrating the use of the Automation API. FlexMonkey is built on top of a slightly modified version of AutoQuick. (Learn [more](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/)).
